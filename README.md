This will integrate a slimmed down / modified welcome crate
along with an off the shelf zed workspace crate
and a simple app crate similar to gpui-component.

This a fork of the Zed [picker](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/tree/main/crates/picker).

The Editor functionality has been removed and the picker has been updated to work with the tab_switcher in Zed which does not require the editor to be present.
